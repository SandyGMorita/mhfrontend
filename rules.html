            <h4>SPORTSMANSHIP</h4>
            <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals of
                sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose
                behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
