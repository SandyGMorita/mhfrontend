            <h4>SPORTSMANSHIP</h4>
            <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals of
                sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose
                behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                    associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that
                    meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its
                    Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the
                    minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable
